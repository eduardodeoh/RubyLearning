=begin  
  Sequences have a start point, an end point, and a way to  
  produce successive values in the sequence  
  In Ruby, sequences are created using the ".." and "..."  
  range operators.  
  The two dot form creates an inclusive range.  
  The three-dot form creates a  range that excludes the specified  
  high value  
  The sequence 1..100000 is held as a Range object

digits = -1..9  
puts digits.include?(5)          # true  
puts digits.min                  # -1  
puts digits.max                  # 9  
puts digits.reject {|i| i < 5 }  # [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
