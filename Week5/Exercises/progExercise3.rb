#Exercise3: Here are the program specifications for a simple game to be played against the computer:
#
#This game is played at the command-line.
#The game starts when the computer selects three consecutive cells in a 7 cell row (from 0 to 6). When that's complete, the game asks for your first guess.
#Guess the computer's selected cells in the smallest number of guesses. You are given a rating or level, based on how well you perform.
#At the command line, the user types in a number from 0 to 6. The computer checks if it's one of the selected cells. If it's a hit, increment the no_of_hits variable. In response to your guess, you'll see a result at the command-line: either "Hit", "Miss" or "End".
#When you have guessed all three cells, the game ends by printing out your rating (your number of guesses).
#Notes:
#
#Use only the features we have learned so far, in Ruby.
#You must design the Object::GameBoard class.
#The testgameboard.rb program uses your GameBoard class
